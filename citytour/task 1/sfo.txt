History
	▪	San Francisco was inhabited by the Ohlone before being colonized by Spaniards. After their arrival, the Spanish established the mission San Francisco de Asis in the new Presidio of San Francisco. After Mexico gained independence from Spain, William Richardson and Alcalde Fransisco de Haro founded the town of Yerba Buena, attracting American settlers. During the Mexican-American war, Yerba Buena was ceded to the United States and renamed San Fransisco.
	▪	The California Gold Rush in 1849 led to a massive population boom for San Fransisco, leading to the construction of a harbor. After California gained statehood, several entrepreneurs founded companies like Wells Fargo, Levi’s, and Ghirardelli, and the growing population necessitated the building of the Pacific Railroad. A significant percentage of the new inhabitants were Asian, and had immigrated to work on the railroad. By 1901, San Fransisco had become a major American city.
	▪	A massive earthquake in 1906 killed several hundreds of people and left thousands more homeless, with many people moving to the East Bay. However, the city was rapidly rebuilt, and celebrated its rebirth at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.
	▪	San Fransisco grew further as a financial capital, and remained afloat during the Great Depression. It was also during this time that the Golden Gate Bridge and San Fransisco-Oakland Bay Bridge were built. During World War II, several African Americans moved to San Fransisco due to an explosion in jobs, and the Treaty of San Fransisco ended the war with Japan.
	▪	In the mid-1900s, the suburbs of San Fransisco grew rapidly, with an increasing wave of immigration from Asia and Latin America countering a exodus of the white population. San Fransisco became a beacon of counterculture, with the San Fransisco Renaissance and the Summer of Love in 1967, and also became a center of the gay rights movement.
	▪	Another earthquake in 1989 caused destruction and death in the Bay Area, but once again, San Fransisco was able to rebuild, revitalizing Hayes Valley and The Embarcadero. In recent years, the rise of the internet industry has birthed several startups, and technology and entrepreneurship remain staples of the economy.
